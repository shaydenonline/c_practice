These are some practice problems I did (by myself) to learn C. They come from Applied C. There are some cool libraries including:
1. Adding two integers of any size together in ch_19/string_math. 
2. Converting any binary file to UUENCODE in ch_18/uuencode.
3. Transposing and multiplying matrices in ch_17
